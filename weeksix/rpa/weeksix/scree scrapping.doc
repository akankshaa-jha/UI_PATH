Robotic process automation (RPA) is a form of business process automation that is based on software robots (bots) or artificial intelligence (AI) agents.[1] RPA should not be confused with artificial intelligence as it is based on automation technology following a predefined workflow.[2]  It is sometimes referred to as software robotics (not to be confused with robot software).
